									<h4> 1) NIRSpec IFS observations of a massive galaxy at z~3.5 and its close environment </h4>
									<p> 
										As part of the  Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (<strong><a href="https://ga-nifs.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">GA-NIFS</a></strong>) GTO team, 
										I lead the study of GS5001, a z~3.5 massive galaxy at the centre of a proto-cluster.
									
										 By mapping for the first time all main rest-frame optical lines (from [OII]3726 to [SIII]9531), 
										we inferred the kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as well as spatially resolved interstellar gas properties  
										(ionisation, metallicity, dust extinction) within the individual galaxies.
										 NIRSpec observations revealed two additional companions, and clear evidence of galaxy interactions between one
										of them and the central galaxy. Moreover, we identify a star-formation driven outflow in the central target,
										associated with high level of extinction.<br/>

									<h4> 2) Molecular outflows in nearby ULIRGs </h4>

									<p> 
										
										During my first postdoc, I investigated the properties of cold molecular outflows in a sample of 25 nearby (z <0.02) 
										ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) from the <strong>PUMA (Physics of ULIRGs with MUSE and ALMA)</strong> 
											project (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A.101P/abstract" target="_blank">Perna et al. 2021</a>, 
											<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...651A..42P/abstract" target="_blank">Pereira-Santaella et al. 2021</a>). 
											The PUMA project combines MUSE and ALMA data to investigate the multiphase outflows and the related feedback in local starbursts 
											and AGN. 
										<br/>
										We use <strong>ALMA CO(2-1) high-resolution (~500pc, 0.2 arcsec)</strong> observations to trace <strong>molecular outflows</strong> and 
											characterise their properties. We detect molecular outflows in ~80% of the sample.
										Thanks to the high resolution, we could determine the direction of the outflows and we found that outflows in starburst-dominated nuclei 
											are more likely to be perpendicular to the disk, while AGN ouflows can have any direction.
										We also found that these molecular outflows are more consistent with being momentum-driven than energy-driven.
										<!-- 
										Moreover, I am the P.I. of two ALMA programs to further investigate the ISM conditions in these ULIRGs, 
											in particular to study the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. This factor is critical for the estimation of mass outflow rates,
											and will be therefore essential to confirm our recent results -->

(2022). This means that there are other factors that contribute to set the outflow rate in these galaxies

												Moreover, we found that the <strong> mass outflow rates do not follow a tight relation with the AGN luminosities</strong>, as reported in previous works (e.g. Cicone et al. 2014).

									<h4>3) ALMA continuum observations of z~2 AGN and the elusive evidence of outflows influencing star formation </h4>

									<p> 
										The <strong>SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and the Effect of Radiative feedback (SUPER)</strong> is a SINFONI Large Program at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). 
										This survey is designed to perform high-resolution, spatially-resolved spectroscopy of multiple emission lines (Hβ, [OIII], Hα) of a carefully selected sample of ~40 active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z~2.  The goals of this program are:<br />
										&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i) to study the incidence of outflows in AGN at cosmic noon; <br />
										&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii) to map the ionised outflows morphology using [OIII] and constrain their impact of star-formation; <br />
										&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii) to investigate variations of outflow properties as a function of the host galaxy properties.<br />

										

										<!--The FIR observations can be used to trace dust obscured star-formation. This is particularly useful in the case of AGN, where other star-formation tracers suffer more heavily from the contamination by AGN emission. In thi project, we use FIR continuum observations combined with spatially resolved observations of the ionized gas to investigate the impact of AGN outfows on star-formation at z ~ 2. We do not find evidence of suppression of dust-obscured star-formation in the regions where the outflows are located. However, we do not have a spatially-resolved map of a good tracer of recent star-formation, thus we can not rule out that the outflows are affecting star-formation on short time-scales.<br/>
										<br/> -->
									</p> 
									<p> 
										To assess the impact that AGN outflows may have on star-formation, it is important to take into account both the unobscured and the obscured star-formation.
										In this project, we used <strong>high-resolution (~ 2kpc, 0.2") far-infrared (FIR) ALMA Band-7 continuum observations of 8 AGN</strong> from SUPER to study the impact that AGN outflows may have on the dust distribution, and possibly star-formation of the hosts. The majority of our sample show different morphologies for the far-infrared (mostly due to reprocessed stellar emission) and the ionised gas emission (Hα and [OIII], mostly due to AGN emission). <strong>Under the assumption that the far-infrared emission is a reliable tracer of obscured star formation, we find that the obscured star formation activity in these AGN host galaxies is not clearly affected by the ionised outflows</strong>. However, we cannot rule out that star formation suppression is happening on smaller spatial scales than the ones we probe with our observations (< 2 kpc) or on different timescales.<br />

									<h4> 4) Dust properties of nearby galaxies: JINGLE survey</h4>

									<p> For the main project of my PhD, I used data from the <strong>JCMT dust and gas In Nearby Galaxies Legacy Exploration Survey (JINGLE)</strong> . 
									Dust observations can be used to probe galaxy evolution, serving as a less time consuming tool to measure the gas content of galaxies.
										This has a great potential for the study of dwarf galaxies and objects at z>2, where molecular gas measurements through classical
										CO emission line observations are hard. In order to use dust to trace the gas content of galaxies, it is necessary to understand 
										how dust properties vary across the galaxy population. <strong> The JINGLE survey is a large program at the 
										<a href="https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/about-jcmt/"target="_blank">James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)</a> 
										which aims to characterize the dust properties of nearby galaxies, study their relation with the gas content and how they vary 
											as a function of other key galaxy properties. </strong> <br />

												<p> 
													As part of the JINGLE survey, I developed a method to fit the far-IR to submm SED of the JINGLE galaxies using modified black-body models (MBB). 
													The main limitation of the MBB model is the intrinsic degeneracy between the dust temperature and the dust emissivity index &beta;. To solve this problem, I used a <strong>hierarchical Bayesian approach, which helps to reduce the T- &beta; degeneracy </strong>. After applying this technique to the JINGLE sample, the T-β anti-correlation is strongly reduced and I obtain better estimates of the dust parameters.<br />

													I also derive scaling relations between dust properties and global galaxy properties which can be used to estimate the dust temperature and emissivity index &beta; in galaxies for which there are not enough photometric data available to measure them directly through SED fitting.  <br />

									<h4> 5) CO(3-2) as a tracer of dense molecular gas </h4>

									<p> 
										The most commonly used tracer of molecular hydrogen in galaxies is the CO molecule. The CO(J=1-0) emission  line traces both the dense and diffuse molecular gas. The higher level CO(J=3-2) transition instead traces denser molecular gas, which is thought to be more directly related to star-formation. 
										<br/>
										<!--Therefore the CO(3-2) transition may be a better tracer of the dense molecular gas responsible for the star-formation.-->


										In this project, we investigate the <strong>relation between the r<sub>31</sub>=L<sub>CO(3-2)</sub>/L<sub>CO(1-0)</sub> luminosity line ratio and the star-formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M(H<sub>2</sub>) </strong> in a sample of star-forming galaxies and AGN hosts from xCOLD GASS (Saintonge et al. 2011a, 2017), BASS (Koss et al. 2017) and SLUGS (Yao et al. 2003). We find a trend for the r<sub>31</sub> line ratio to increase with star-formation efficiency. If we interpret the r<sub>31</sub> as a tracer of the gas density, we can infer that the star-formation efficiency is not only related to the amount of molecular gas present in the galaxy but also on the fraction of the molecular gas which is in the dense phase.<br/>

										Using the photon-dissociation region (PRD) code <i>UCL-PDR</i>, I model the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio for different gas conditions and conclude that the <strong>main parameter affecting this line ratio is indeed the gas density</strong>, while the UV radiation field and the cosmic rays play only a minor role.
										<br/>
										This work is presented in Lamperti et al. (2020): <strong> <i> The CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) luminosity line ratio in nearby star-forming galaxies and AGN from xCOLD GASS, BASS and SLUGS </i> </strong>. Here is the link to the paper:

									<h4> 6) BASS: BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey </h4>
									<p> 
										During my Bachelor and Master at ETH Zürich, I worked on projects related to the BASS survey.
										The <strong>BASS</strong> survey is the <strong>spectroscopic follow-up of the AGN detected in the hard X-rays by the <i>Neil Gehrels Swift</i>/BAT telescope</strong>. The goal of the survey is to obtain emission line measurements, black hole masses and X-ray observations for a large sample of the brightest nearby AGN.
										As part of my Bachelor projects, I worked on the emission line fitting and black hole mass measurements from the velocity dispersion of ~600 AGN spectra for the first data release DR1 <a  href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850...74K"> (Koss et al. 2017). </a>

												For my Master Thesis, I focused on the analysis of the <strong>near-infrared (NIR) spectra of a sub-sample of ~100 BAT AGN</strong>. 
												The NIR part of the spectrum is less susceptible to obscuration than the optical, and this allows us to study <strong>hidden broad 
												line region</strong> that not visible in the optical. The NIR broad lines can be used to estimate the mass of the supermassive black hole. 
												I also investigate the possibility to use NIR spectroscopy to identify AGN that are missed from optical emission line diagnostics. 
												The presence of <strong>NIR coronal lines</strong> is an indicator of AGN activity, due to their high-ionization potential ( > 100 eV), 
												and they can be used as an AGN selection criterion. I detect coronal lines in 43% of the AGN in our sample.<br/>

									<!-- <h4> Impact of ionized outflows on star-formation in z~2 AGN  </h4>

									<p> 
										The FIR observations can also be used to trace dust obscured star-formation. This is particularly useful in the case of AGN, where other star-formation tracers suffer more heavily from the contamination by AGN emission. In thi project, we use FIR continuum observations combined with spatially resolved observations of the ionized gas to investigate the impact of AGN outfows on star-formation at z ~ 2. We do not find evidence of suppression of dust-obscured star-formation in the regions where the outflows are located. However, we do not have a spatially-resolved map of a good tracer of recent star-formation, thus we can not rule out that the outflows are affecting star-formation on short time-scales.<br/>
										<br/>

						
										This work is part of the <strong>SUPER</strong> survey, a SINFONI Large Program at the VLT targeting a sample of ~40 AGN. SUPER has obtained  high-resolution, spatially-resolved IFU observations of several optical emission lines (Ha, Hbeta, OIII). One of the main goal is to study the occurrence of outflows in AGN host galaxies and their link with the physical properties of the host and the SMBH.<br/>
